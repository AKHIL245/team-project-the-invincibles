# XP Core Values 

## Communication - 
I actively supported an XP core value by contributing to front-end development and overseeing all aspects of our team project. This enabled us to complete project requirements within the designated timeframe and track progress at the end of each sprint. Adhering to XP principles, we emphasized active participation, took responsibility for project activities, managed time effectively, and regularly assessed our progress. This approach ensured a successful outcome and demonstrated our commitment to the project's success.

## Simplicity - 
I made a notable contribution in upholding the XP principle by ensuring the consistent flow of the project. My primary responsibility involved managing the backend of the program and ensuring transparency, integrity, and reliability at all stages. Leveraging my expertise and prior experience with the technology stack, I facilitated the team's comprehension of the project's core concept. Moreover, I provided valuable guidance in task prioritization, utilizing my knowledge to support the project's smooth and successful execution.


## Feedback - 
I played a pivotal part in advocating for the fundamental XP principle by consistently offering feedback throughout the sprints. This facilitated the generation of fresh ideas and continuous improvement with each iteration of our work. Furthermore, I actively focused on minimizing the duration of interdependent tasks, utilizing my expertise and comprehension to contribute to the project's seamless implementation.

## Courage - 
I demonstrated my commitment to the XP core principle by actively participating in the front-end development of the project. Emphasizing the value of honesty, I consistently provided sincere feedback to the team, offering pragmatic guidance to address each challenge while considering potential outcomes. Taking the lead in researching and acquiring proficiency in the necessary technologies, I played a vital role during the project's initial setup phase. Moreover, I maintained a positive attitude, motivating the team during difficult circumstances and enabling us to overcome obstacles through collaborative problem-solving.

## Respect - 
we embraced the XP principle of Respect by prioritizing the appreciation and value of every team member throughout our collaboration. We cultivated an environment where all viewpoints and ideas were treated with equal respect and received thoughtful consideration. Active listening was a shared practice, ensuring that each team member had a voice. Our collective efforts were dedicated to delivering a high-quality project within the designated timeline. By upholding the other four XP values alongside Respect, we fostered a culture that nurtured mutual respect and ultimately contributed to our achievements.

# Steps to test and run the application

1. Clone the repository git clone 

2. Run Backend server - node server.js

3. For Frontend - run npm install and npm start

4. The web application opens in the default browser


# Deployment to AWS

## Amazon S3: Deployed our Frontend Application on AWS S3 enabling static web hosting.

# Why MERN Stack
The MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, is a popular choice for web development due to its versatility, scalability, and efficiency. By leveraging JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, the MERN stack allows for seamless integration and code sharing. MongoDB provides flexibility in handling unstructured data, while Express.js simplifies server-side development. React enables the creation of dynamic user interfaces, and Node.js ensures high-performance server-side operations. With a large and active community, the MERN stack offers abundant resources and support for developers. Its modular architecture and component-based approach facilitate rapid prototyping and iteration.

# Why NoSQL database?
NoSQL databases are favored for their flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages in modern application development. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases offer a schemaless design, allowing developers to store and retrieve unstructured or semi-structured data with ease. This flexibility enables agile development and simplifies the adaptation to changing data requirements. NoSQL databases excel at handling large amounts of data and are highly scalable, horizontally distributing data across multiple servers or clusters to accommodate growing workloads. Their high-performance capabilities and optimized data models result in faster query execution and improved overall system performance.

# Hosting on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS S3

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is designed to simplify the deployment and management of web applications, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than worrying about infrastructure details. With Elastic Beanstalk, one can easily deploy applications to the cloud with just a few clicks or through automation.
One of the key components we leveraged is EC2 instance. These instances serve as the compute resources that host our web application. Elastic Beanstalk takes care of provisioning and managing these instances, making it easy for us to scale our application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
To ensure high availability and optimal performance, we made use of the Load Balancer feature in Elastic Beanstalk. The Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, allowing us to handle increased load and ensuring that our application remains responsive even during high traffic periods. 
Another essential aspect of our deployment was Auto Scaling. With Auto Scaling, Elastic Beanstalk automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on the demand our application receives. During peak traffic periods, it automatically scales up the number of instances to handle the load, and during quieter times, it scales down to save costs.
